Red Team : Offensive security 

Blue Team : Defensive security

Purple Team : Mixture of both Offensive and Defensive security


Cybersecurity conferences :

	- DEF CON :
		+ Held in Vegas 
		+ Incident Response (Blue Team)
		+ Capture the flag competition - (CTF)

	- Pwn2Own :
		+ Hacking contest held at CanSecWest Security Conference 
			- Not a conference, just a hacking competition that focuses on  discovering new vulnerabilities in the 
			  world of cybersecurity 

		+ Similar to the Black Hat Conference
			- Red Team

	- Black Hat Conference :
		+ Big cybersecurity conference that focuses on  revealing new vulnerabilities 
		+ Red Team 

	- RSA Conference or (RSAC) :
		+ Cover the entire spectrum of cybersecurity 
		+ Purple Team
			- Mixture of Red team And Blue Team

Which of the following techniques should be used to mitigate the risk of data remanence 
      when moving virtual hosts from one server to another in the cloud ? :

	- Use Full-disk encryption:
		+ Correct Answer 
		- reason: 
			# This method will ensure that all data is encrypted and cannot be exposed to other organizations
				 or the underlying IaaS provider.

	- Use Data Masking: 
		+ Wrong Answer
		- reasons :
			# This techniques just replace the information with filler characters like 'X' to prevent the data from being read, 
				but the data will still be exposed to anyone to see

	- zero-wipe drives before moving systems:
		+  Wrong Answer
		- reason :
			# This method is impossible, the reason being virtual machines systems can move user data without user intervention during 				scaling hours

	- Span multiple virtual disks to fragment data :
		+ Wrong Answer:
		- reason :
			# this method will only make the data harder to access by third parties because it separated into different locations,
				but the data is still available for someone to see

Reconnaissance Technique :

	- A DNS forward or reverse lookup :
		+ Passive or Active Techniques 
			- Depending on the Hacker

		+ Used to find out what ip address correspond to what name or what name correspond to what ip address


	- A whois query :
		+ Passive Technique (*)
		+ Used to search for domain names, ip address block and other identifiable information that give hackers information about a company 			in databases or autonomous system

	- A zone transfer :
		+ Active Technique
		+ Used to replicate DNS databases across a set DNS servers	

	- Using maltego :
 		+ Passive Technique
		+ OSIN :
			- Open Source Intelligence and Forensics
			
		+ used to visualize information in a graph format suitable for link analysis and data mining
		+ gather information from whois lookup servers, DNS lookup ad email

Scanning Techniques ( Weather or Not it will trigger IPS ) :

	- NMAP stealth scan :
		+ Wrong Answer
		- reason:
			# More invasive	than DNS attacks and IPS/IDS systems are on a lookout for these type of attacks

	- DNS zone transfer :
		+ Wrong Answer
		- reason:
			# More invasive	than DNS attacks and IPS/IDS systems are on a lookout for these type of attacks

	- DNS brute-force attack :
		+ Correct Answer
		- reason :
			# DNS queries on a network often appears as normal Traffic 

	- NMAP ping sweep :
		+ Wrong Answer
		- reason:
			# More invasive	than DNS attacks and IPS/IDS systems are on a lookout for these type of attacks
