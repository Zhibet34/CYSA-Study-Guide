cyber threat intelligence life cycle :
	- planning & direction : define the mission
		* things to keep in mind in this step
				- primary asset
				- bussiness risk
				- available controls
				- initial C-T-I goal

	- collection : Assembling the raw material from diffrent sources
		sources:
			+ commercial feed
			+ osin
			+ mal information sharing platform
			+ vendor threat report
		
	- processing : normalize the data
		+ normalises
		+ correlates and deduplicate
		+ tag
		+ converts
	- analysis : see how the process data fits into the current investigation
	- dissemination : communicate the finding
	- feedback : wait for feedback from people inside the organization

Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) :
	+ four-colr labeling scheme that governs how widely intel may be shared
		- colors :
			* Clear = no restriction
			* Green	= shared with peer communinty but not publicly 
			* Amber = organisation-wide, external sharing only with need to know client
			* Red = named recipients only
	+ threat intel can be found in Threat information expression (STIX)

EDR :
	- endpoint dection response

Cyber Threat Intelligence Frameworks and standard :
	
	** MITRE **
	- As an L1 analyst, you can use the matrix during an investigation in the following way (ATTACK):

		+ Match the behaviour in the alert to a tactic/technique pair.
		+ Write the ID in your triage note: "Observed T1071.001 (web-based C2) against FINANCE-TRYHATME-00".
		+ and the note to Level 2 or Incident Response; they instantly know which mitigations and threat-actor profiles apply.

	- (D3FEND) catalogues how defenders respond , A case for this would look similar to this:

		+ Your proxy raises a T1048.003 DNS tunnel alert.
		+ Search D3FEND for the matching defensive technique: D3—NTDN DNS—request analysis. The page lists practical controls:
	 	+ block extensive TXT records and alert on uncommon query entropy.
		+ Add the most feasible control to your "next actions" field

	- Cyber kill chain :  breaks down adversary actions into steps

	- CVE, CVSS and NVD
	
	- Sharing and proccessing intel
		+ stix
		+ taxii
			- collection : ensures threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer
			- channel :  publishes threat intel to users from a central server
